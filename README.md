# Crop-Recommendation-System-Using-Ensemble-Learning-With-99-Percent-Accuracy
My ensemble crop recommendation model achieves 99% accuracy by combining Random Forest, SVM, and CNN architectures. It analyzes soil nutrients (N, P, K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to suggest optimal crops for farmers, enhancing agricultural productivity through data-driven decisions.
